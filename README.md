# Godot-LiteDB
 Provides a Godot 4 wrapper for LiteDB to allow node based instantiation of a database.

The solution may need to have a reference added to lite DB using Nuget. The repository can be found here:
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiteDB

The node will appear as LiteDBNode when adding a new node.

The nodes "Save File Path" needs to be configured with a project path such as user://my_database.db.

After this, the documentation can be followed directly at the following address:
